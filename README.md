# Sequential-Modeling-with-Recurrent-Neural-Networks
This module is part of the Deep Learning with Keras learning path â€“ complete this path to learn how to apply deep learning algorithms in Python's Keras library. Learn the concepts and applications of RNNs (specifically, Long Short-Term Method networks) and implement these architectures to build sequential models to predict results.
